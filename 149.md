    BUIP149: Delimited OP_RETURNs

    Status: rejected


Summary
-------
The purpose of this BUIP is to get a commitment from Bitcoin Unlimited to support a proposal to change how OP_RETURN functions within Bitcoin Cash.


Proposals
---------
I propose that we raise the OP_RETURN size limitation and rework the OP_RETURN opcode, so that instead of being used only as the first opcode of an OP_RETURN output, it:

- Can be used more than once within an OP_RETURN output.
- Every time it is used it acts as a delimiter that makes the following push operations semantically grouped.
- Every time it is used, it limits how much data can be pushed after it.

This means that old OP_RETURN transactions will be parsed exactly the same as new ones (since the old only have one OP_RETURN opcode), which makes the old transactions forward-compatible. This also means that it becomes possible to use more than one OP_RETURN based protocol within a single transaction. By also having a limitation on how much data can be pushed, we can structurally prevent a situation where some protocol would make itself incompatible with any other by accident.

I propose that we raise the OP_RETURN size limitation to 512b or 1024b and that we make the max size between OP_RETURNS either 255b or 511b respectively, to guarantee that any two protocols will always work together.

The numbers are provided as an example for discussion and to set a ballpark of what the expectations are, but should not be seen as a requirement for this proposal.


Motivation
----------

By commiting to support this change of OP_RETURN functionality, Bitcoin Unlimited would send a signal to other node software developers that this is something that is possible to change under consensus and would help start the necessary discussions in the community.


Background
----------

With the expanse of OP_RETURN based protocols and the widespread adoption of SLP tokens there is a need to enable cross-protocol collaboration. We cannot predict all possible usecases for this feature, but there is already several protocols that either see a benefit to this (CashIntents with SLP) or that are working around current limitations in awkward ways (SLP and SLPDEX).


Budget
None
