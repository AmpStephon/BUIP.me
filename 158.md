    BUIP 158: Funding for SysAdmin/Developer
    Proposer: @sickpig
    Submitted on: 2020-11-30
    Status: passed

## Summary

I lost my independent funding in November of this year, regardless I would like to continue working on the Bitcoin Unlimited projects as a full time developer and devops, as I have been doing since since 2015.

From mid 2015 till the end of 2016 I worked on the project on my free time, luckily enough later on I got an offer to have my full time work for Bitcoin Unlimited funded and this is what I did and I'm still doing so far.

## Budget

This BUIP authorises 84,000 EUR a year (paid monthly in crypto) to continue this work.

Other then the day to day tasks of reviewing pull requests from others, fixing bugs and implementing minor enhancements, the following are the main contributions I made to the BCH Unlimited client and more in general to other Bitcoin Unlimited projects:
