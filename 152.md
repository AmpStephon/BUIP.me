I have produced an Android and Enterprise (JVM) wallet based on libbitcoincash (an extraction of the fundamentally useful parts of bitcoind into a .so that can be used by wallets), and a Kotlin networking and middleware layer that I call libbitcoincashkotlin.

This wallet has a lot of the cool features required by wallets, such as BIP21 (payment URI) and Bitpay's Payment Protocol. And it has new features such as the BCHidentity work (http://www.bitcoinunlimited.net/identity__protocol), and more to come. Its an HD wallet, using the standard BCH derivation path and recovery phrases. Under the covers, it uses both the P2P and the Electrum protocols to access the network.

The Android wallet is intended to be a simple wallet for daily use by new crypto users, rather than a complex wallet with every function or a wallet meant for long term storage. At the same time, it explores new features that I think will be useful for its target use case and I have other features planned.

The Enterprise wallet takes the same engine and creates a kotlin-scriptable, desktop wallet.

These wallets should currently be considered Alpha/experimental quality, and therefore not used with very much money!

Access to the source code, MIT licensed, and an invite to the google play alpha testers or a link to an APK is available to any BU members, just contact me.

This BUIP proposes that these wallets be "officially" adopted by BU, rather than remain work almost exclusively done and copyrighted by me. I believe that a vote is needed here, since in a pedantic sense, these wallets compete with the wallet inside the BU full node. However, it has been pretty clear for years now that the typical user will not run a full node for its wallet.

Additionally, officially adopting them smoothes the path to writing BUIPs for funding tasks related to this work, and would allow me to release APKs and JARs as "official" releases in the bitcoinunlimited.info web site (no tasks are currently envisioned that would need funding).
