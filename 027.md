    Status: passed

**Summary**  
  
This is an Operational BUIP requesting BU membership approval for the
expenditure to hold a small conference for the purpose of bringing
together noted\* Bitcoin developers to overview, discuss, critique and
prioritize many of the leading software enhancements which enable a far
higher capacity for transactional throughput *on-chain.*  
\* active developers of any full-node implementation who also support
the on-chain scaling ethos.  
  
**Objectives**  
  
This conference has several strands:

1.  Reaffirmation of Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision described in his
    > 2008 whitepaper and later forum correspondence.

2.  Make the case for multiple implementations, i.e. decentralized
    > development, resolving the last major centralizing force within
    > the Bitcoin ecosystem.

3.  Presentations: Selected items drawn from the Bitcoin Unlimited
    > proposed development
    > [*roadmap*](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/bitcoin-unlimited-proposed-development-roadmap.1401/).

4.  Panel and breakout discussions to debate specific on-chain scaling
    > changes

5.  Networking: CTOs from Bitcoin ecosystem businesses will be invited
    > to participate.

6.  Prepare the groundwork for paid developers to enhance BU full-node
    > software on a per-project basis which are approved by technical
    > BUIPs.

7.  Publicity for BU itself as a growing centre of development
    > excellence for Bitcoin full-node software.

**Expenditure**
