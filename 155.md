We ask prospective members to provide a public key which they will use for voting. Bitcoin Unlimited is a participatory organization where people devote a small amount of time, every couple of months to guide the direction of the software and org itself.

We use only legacy addresses in the voting system at present.

More links to external posting history (e.g. Twitter, Medium, Facebook, Reddit) are welcome, and I'll add them here. In the current adversarial climate the links prove helpful to existing members to make their evaluation.
