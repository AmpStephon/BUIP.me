    Status: draft

## Background

In 2015, the journal Ledger became the first periodical launched for academic research in cryptocurrency with a focus on Bitcoin technology. Ledger aims to encourage greater involvement by academics in cryptocurrency and foster a culture of rigorous analysis and peer-review within the Bitcoin community and the wider blockchain and cryptographic fields. There are annual issues: (Vol 1. 2016, Vol 2. 2017, Vol 3. 2018, Vol 4. 2019, Vol 5. 2020).

## Motivation

Bitcoin Unlimited provides Bitcoin full-node software, but also has a long-term research and development role, actively prototyping a variety of improvements to its full-node suite for associated business-use functionality and high-volume scalability. So, support for Ledger journal is a good fit with B.U.'s R&D work.

B.U. has been one of two funding contributors from the start with [BUIP046](046.md). However, this funding is completed. In order to help secure the journal's future, it requires ongoing funding. Aims for the future include a regular newsletter, improved journal presentation, website revamp, increased frequency of output to 6 monthly or even quarterly. The [University of Pittsburghi](http://www.pitt.edu/) publishes the Ledger journal via the [University Library System](http://www.library.pitt.edu/). However, B.U. should mirror the Ledger archive, bringing more Bitcoin information to one place.

## Budget

$18,000 per annum until changed or cancelled by another BUIP.
