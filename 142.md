Summary
-------
The purpose of this BUIP is to develop and maintain a public set of test cases and test data to complement the public Bitcoin Cash specification from BUIP121.

Proposal
-------
This BUIP proposes that we use bitcoin unlimited funds to:
1. Compile a public set of structured testing data
2. Add new test data twice a year in preparation for scheduled hard forks.
3. Maintain this testing data as a long-term commitment.

Motivation
-------
Having proper and extensive testing data is helps ensure that the various network participants remain in consensus during upgrades and lowers the cost of entry for new participants.

Budget
-------
A maximum expenditure cap of $5,000 per month, for a period no longer than 6 months, is proposed for the technical author and programming work involved.

Background
-------
Currently there is a lot of information on how Bitcoin and it's derivates operate, but validating that production code is consistent with the overall consensus is still cause for concern.

As a community we embrace the concept of multiple implementations and strength through diversity, but if we cannot act on it in practice it will remain an idea and the benefits will be lost. Building up a set of testing data is beneficial for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem and helps foster the environment in which multiple implementations will be a reality.
