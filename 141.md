    BUIP141: Restrict voting rights for Non-publicly identified members
    Submitted by torusJKL
    Date: 2019-11-30
    Status: rejected

Motivation
----------
BU strives to give its members equal voting rights.
The problem with members that are not publicly identified is that one person could be controlling multiple entities and as a result receive more power than others.

Objectives
----------
This BUIP does not want to remove those members from BU but limit their power.

Definition
----------
Non-publicly identified members, hereafter NPIM, are those who have an anonymous profile and can't be identified in the real world based on the information they have provided in public to all BU members.

Voting restrictions
----------
A NPIM can't vote on BUIPs that involve:
- changes to the Articles of Federation
- changes to the rights/restrictions of a NPIM (not including this one)
- voting for new BU members
- voting on existing BU members

Exceptions
----------
A NPIM could be declared as as known by the BU president if the member has made himself known to the president (this can happen in private).
In this case the member will have the same voting rights as a publicly known member.
This exception is voided once a new president is elected and the NPIM would need to make himself known to the new president if he wishes to receive full voting rights again.


Articles of Federation
----------
This BUIP is not a change to the BU Articles of Federation as the possibility of voting rights restrictions are defined under

2. II, Member:
> an individual who is invited (by BUIP) to join the Confederation, signs this document, and has joined or voted within the last 1 year.
** Non-publicly identified members may have restricted voting or other restrictions as determined by subsequent BUIPs - this measure may be needed to restrict duplicate accounts.**

As such the regular voting rules apply to this BUIP.
