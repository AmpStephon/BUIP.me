Prospective members are asked to provide a public key which they will
use for voting. Bitcoin Unlimited is a participatory organization where
we do ask that people devote a small amount of time, every couple of
months to guide the direction of the software and org itself.

More links to external posting history (e.g. Twitter, Medium, Facebook,
Reddit) are welcome, and I'll add them here. In the current adversarial
climate the links prove helpful to existing members to make their
evaluation.
