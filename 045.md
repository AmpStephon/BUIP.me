This is mostly an adaptation of [*Rusty Russel's
work*](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=578) for
[BUIP037](037.mediawiki "wikilink").  
  
The address is composed of the following elements:  
1. Prefix for type, followed by colon. Currently "btc:" or "testnet:".  
2. The version field, encoded using
[*z-base32*](http://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt)  
3. The hash field, encoded using
[*z-base32*](http://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt)  
4. At least 35 bits for crc64-ecma, up to a multiple of 5 to reach a
letter boundary. This covers the prefix (as ascii), the version and the
hash.  
5. The final letter is the [*Damm
algorithm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damm_algorithm) check digit of
the entire previous string, using the 32 way quasigroup formed by
GF(2^5) and x^5 + x^2 + 1 as base polynomial and n = 2\*x + y as
generator.  
  
Step 4 and 5 add 8 characters to the address, 7 for CRC and 1 for Damm,
and ensure this  
  
This has various advantages:  
- A unified address format for all current addresses and futures
features to come.  
- Nicer looking than base58 - subjective but base58 addresses tends to
be intimidating for newcomers.  
- Protected against errors via a CRC64.  
- Protected against any single character change via Damm.  
- As long as the number of version is kept under 64, the first letter
indicate the type of address as it is the 5 most significant digit of
the version.  
- Addresses are compact enough, 42 digit for 20B hash, 61 for 32B.  
  
Example (I did not run CRC or Damm on them, just filled with random
digits):  
btc:yybul3unspd4bn2aji33natie5sd2iqsikrfgm8ejk (42 digits for a P2KH,
20B hash).  
btc:b1ee6ceodhmo2d0rmr7utt31u0163kdoakirgoigsd112d5batlt2a (61 digits
for a P2SH, 32B hash).
