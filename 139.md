    BUIP139: Multiple OP_RETURN with less rules
    Submitted by: Jonathan Silverblood
    Date: 2019-11-14
    Status: draft


Summary
-------

The purpose of this BUIP is to get a commitment from Bitcoin Unlimited to support a change to the standardness rules that would allow for users to make and broadcast transactions with multiple OP_RETURN outputs given certain constraints.


Proposals
---------

I propose that we replace the standardness rule that enforces a maximum of one OP_RETURN output per transaction with a rule that instead enforces no more than some limited number of OP_RETURNs per transaction. The existing rule for maximum size per individual OP_RETURN remains unchanged.

Example numbers of 2, 3 and 4 are provided as an example for discussion and to set a ballpark of what the expectations are, but should not be seen as a requirement for this proposal.


Motivation
----------

By commiting to support this change to standardness, Bitcoin Unlimited would send a signal to other node software developers that this is something that is possible to change under consensus and would help start the necessary discussions in the community.


Background
----------

With the expanse of OP_RETURN based protocols and the widespread adoption of SLP tokens there is a need to enable cross-protocol collaboration. We cannot predict all possible usecases for this feature, but there is already several protocols that either see a benefit to this (CashIntents with SLP) or that are working around this limitation in awkward ways (SLP and SLPDEX).


Budget
------

None
