    BUIP144 Voluntary pay out to config list of addresses from mined block coinbases
    Submitted by: freetrader

    Status: draft

Background & Motivation
------------------------

Recently, a consortium of miners have proposed a funding scheme which would divert a certain percentage of Bitcoin Cash coinbase rewards to a development fund.
This scheme has been controversial.

I would propose this BUIP as a potentially less controversial and more decentralized alternative for client software (here BU) to obtain a funding stream from Bitcoin Cash miners who use their software.
If other client softwares followed suit with similar features, the client development projects might garner sufficient miner funding without a need for coercive measures at protocol level.

Technical scope
---------------
This BUIP would propose to implement the following:
- List of optional, additional payout addresses and associated percentage of block reward
    - configuration via additional config file or new parameters in existing (TBD)
    - each address would need to be a valid, either CashAddr or legacy format
    - each address must come with an associated percentage in the range 0.00 - 50.00 %
    - sum of percentage not to exceed 100% in any case
    - the remaining output gets 100% - (the sum of configured additional %) of the block reward
    - any addresses configured to 0% must be ignored
    - RPC call to inspect payout addresses and their percentages
    - default configuration with a BU treasury address and a TBD percentage (recommendation up for discussion in this BUIP: 3% of block reward)
- Testing
    - Unit and regtests
- Documentation
    - goes without saying that this should be a clearly marked out and well documented mechanism, both in the software docs and also in Release Notes, probably some blog posts on the matter so that no BU miners are blindsided
- Project Duration
    - Expedited to complete before next planned BCH upgrade in 15 May 2020.

Budget
------
If the work is done by BU salaried devs, no extra budget to be assigned.

If it's to be done by non-BU-salaried devs, suitable budget must be discussed. Since this work is in relatively critical areas of the client, a starting budget suggestion of $5,000 is proposed here for further discussion.
