    BUIP145: Additional funding for bitcoin cash specification
    Submitted by: Jonathan Silverblood
    Date: 2020-01-12
    Status: passed

Summary
-------
The purpose of this BUIP is to approve additional funding towards building a complete and independent specification for bitcoin cash.

Proposal
--------
This BUIP proposes that we use bitcoin unlimited funds to:
Write a formal specification for Bitcoin Cash
Maintain a formal specification for Bitcoin Cash

Motivation
-----------
Having a proper and full documentation is beneficial to all projects that needs to interact with the Bitcoin Cash network. Particulary, having up to date, accurate and accessible documentation attracts more developer talent, encourages a more diverse ecosystem of node developments and reduces friction for those who want to build applications on top of the network.

Budget
------
Based on the outcome of BUIP121, a maximum expenditure cap of $10,000 per month, for a period no longer than 6 months, is proposed for the technical author work involved.

Background
----------
While we now have a basis with https://reference.cash/ and the groundwork is done to allow for community involvement, the work needed to reach a state where the documentation becomes productive and highly valuable will still need to be done. The talent pool for people able to contribute on this level of documentation is very small. Until we reach a point where community members find significant value in this documentation, we cannot expect the them to commit to the work to keep it maintained and up-to-date, or fill in the remaining blanks.
