***Background***  
  
On the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jonathan Toomim proposed the
"blocktorrent" concept to speed up new block propagation:

<http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-September/011176.html>

A quick survey \[1\] on this forum showed strong interest for
implementing such a mechanism in Bitcoin Unlimited due to potential
improvement in block propagation speeds.  
  
Especially when faced with the future scenario of larger block sizes and
under certain adverse network conditions existing today
(packet/connection loss), the current protocol may be significantly
out-performed by a more fine-grained p2p algorithm.  
  
The main problem with the current algorithm is that it requires a peer
to have a full block before it can upload it to other peers. Breaking up
blocks into smaller chunks and distributing these out of order in a
Bittorrent-like fashion can potentially yield a great speed
improvement.  
  
***Proposal***  
  
A torrent-style distribution of new block data (named 'blocktorrent)
shall be implemented as an optional feature in addition to the existing
p2p block distribution based on 'inv' and 'getdata' (henceforth referred
to in this document as the 'standard p2p network protocol' - SPNP).  
  
The proposed blocktorrent protocol shall be referred to in this document
as 'blocktorrent p2p network protocol - BPNP.  
  
BPNP shall be designed to augment the existing SPNP-based block
propagation in cases where this is deemed beneficial from a propagation
performance viewpoint (through configurable parameters describing block
size and composition) or enforced by the node operator in lieu of
SPNP.  
  
It shall be possible to completely disable BPNP so that the client
remains 100% compatible with implementations not supporting BPNP.  
  
A peer shall be able to advertise its BPNP capabilities to other peers
so that these can decide their optimal methods of exchanging data with
it.  
  
***High level Design***  
  
*As this document is a draft, what follows are provisional high-level
design ideas for further discussion and elaboration.*  
  
The existing p2p network code shall be altered such that it if BPNP is
enabled, a set of BPNP-capable peers is established and used based on
settings to be decided.  
  
*\[Note: *[*@theZerg*](https://bitco.in/forum/members/59/)* advised to
create a transport plugin layer which would be able to accommodate
various kinds of transports, including presumably the current SBNP,
future BPNP, perhaps some more like SCTP-based transport etc. Such a
plugin layer seems a wise architectural decision and I support it, but
would prefer if it was address in a separate BUIP to cleanly distinguish
the layering (and separate the implementation/testing). It would
probably be good to serialize the BUIPs then, starting with the plugin
transport layer one.\]*  
  
There shall be a module (e.g. blocktorrent.cpp) which implements
functionality needed for communicating with the BPNP-capable peers:

</blockquote>

-   management of peer states and network connections (TCP/UDP sockets)

-   block assembly/disassembly routines for incoming/outgoing block data

-   interfaces to existing block validation and generation routines

-   a separate cache of mempool transactions with additional data fields
    > used in the BPNP protocol (e.g. hashes)

-   gathering of metrics on peer connection and block propagation, which
    > may be used to optimize the protocol's performance (e.g. dynamic
    > chunk sizes) or fallback to SBNP where this would be better (e.g.
    > very small blocks)
