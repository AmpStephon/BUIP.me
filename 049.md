Background
----------

So far, a certain number Bitcoin Unlimited members haven't felt that
they needed to vote every time there was an election. Probably in most
cases, they feel that BU is in good hands, and just want to be there to
steady the boat if some major change is proposed or it looks like the
Bitcoin Unlimited project is heading in the wrong direction.

Notably, neither Roger Ver (who runs the first Bitcoin Unlimited pool)
or Hiayang (the founder and CEO of ViaBTC) voted in the last election.
As the rules now stand, this would mean that if they don't vote in the
next 8 1/2 months, they would loose their membership and have to rejoin.

Bitcoin Unlimited was created to give all stakeholders a say. Although
elections are incredibly important and members should seek to
participate actively at all times, members shouldn't be overly penalized
for either not realizing there is an election or not caring about voting
on the latest membership BUIP or conference BUIP. This rule change gives
a grace period so that stakeholders who have been invited to to join our
community can still weigh in at crucial times without having to
needlessly miss a vote while they are re-inducted.

Proposal
--------

In Article 2 of the Articles of Confederation the words,

"Member: an individual who is invited (by BUIP) to join the
Confederation, signs this document, and has joined or voted within the
last 1 year."

shall be struck out, and the following words put in their place,

"Member: an individual who is invited (by BUIP) to join the
Confederation, signs this document, and has joined or voted within the
last 5 years. However, an individual who has not voted within the last
year shall not be considered a member of the quorum."
