## Motivation
Let's Get Building On Bitcoin Cash! After a hard couple of years for BCH and our ecosystem, it seems that the clouds are starting to part and there is energy starting to bubble up. I think this is the perfect time to use this momentum and accelerate it further. One of BU’s most prominent roles in the BCH ecosystem has been in bringing in and supporting new developers.

BU has hosted a number of high-quality conferences, including the various Satoshi’s Vision conferences, and scaling conferences. It now seems like a good time to put these skills and experience to use in pulling developers back into the BCH ecosystem.

## The Event
BU Blockparty will be an online BCH hackathon lasting one week in December (Date TBA). There will be a large prize pool and anyone who wants to develop a product, service or tool on BItcoin Cash will be welcome to participate. Teams need not be made up of just developers. Teams will almost certainly gain value from having business people, graphic designers, project managers, marketers etc.

At least four prizes (paid out in BCH) will be available:
- $9,000 top prize
- $2,000 Category A prize
- $2,000 Category B prize
- $2,000 Category C prize

The hackathon will be publicized through social media, articles on read.cash, and pre-recorded and live-streamed video content to be published to the Bitcoin Unlimited youtube channel. Content will include:
- Interviews with each team during the hackathon.
- Presentations by each team to explain what they are building.
- Presentations by each to showcase what they have built.
- Awards ceremony.

We will be asking highly talented members of the BCH development community to provide some input and direction to teams that enter the hackathon.

## The Rules
- The product, service or tool must be developed from scratch during the hackathon.
- Teams can have from 1-5 members.
- Projects will be judged on a number of factors.
- Teams will be required to write a long form article (to be released before the hackathon starts) detailing what they are building.
- Teams will be asked to write a long form article after the hackathon is finished giving their thoughts on their experience during the hackathon.
- Teams will be required to create a video presenting their hackathon idea for release at the beginning of the hackathon.
- Each teams will be given a public channel within the Bitcoin Unlimited slack and this is to be used for discussion during the hackathon.

## Objectives & Key results

### Get more engagement from existing developers within the BCH ecosystem
- Have at least 10 teams attend the hackathon who are made up of existing BCH developers.
- Get each team to generate three pieces of quality content (before, during and after) the hackathon.

### Bring new developers into the BCH ecosystem
- Have at least 10 teams made up of developers who are new to BCH.
- Collect email addresses of 100 developers interested in building on BCH.
- Get each team to generate three pieces of quality content (before, during and after) the hackathon.
- Work with some of the best

### Highlight Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Unlimited within the wider cryptocurrency space
- Establish at least three partnerships to help promote the hackathon.
- Generate at least 100,000 CTR’s to the hackathon website.
- Generate at least 10,000 CTR’s to other BCH developer info sites, for example bch.info

### Maximise the prize pool
- At least double the prize pool through sponsorships and flipstarter.
- Find at least 3 co-sponsors for the hackathon.

A long-term high-level goal for this event is to establish it as a valuable asset to BU and the BCH ecosystem. If the initial event goes well then we can look towards hosting other similar events in the future under the same brand, and possibly expand into in-person events similar to the previous Satoshi’s Vision Conferences (when this is possible to happen in a safe manner). This also means that all the work done on developing the assets for this first event will be useful for any further events in the future, reducing their overhead.
