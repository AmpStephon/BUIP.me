## Vision for Bitcoin Unlimited

With the benefit of four years of history to look back upon, I believe that BU makes its biggest impact by organizing technical conferences and workshops. Examples of this are the 3 "Satoshi's Vision" events (San Francisco, Tokyo, and Gargnano) and the "Future of Bitcoin" event in Arnhem. It is at these events that new relationships are built, existing relationships strengthened, and the harshness of the on-line reddit/twitter world is softened. These events also serve as "milestone points," motivating people to work hard to get something wrapped up (e.g., so they can present a good talk to their peers), and so these events drive research and development indirectly too. These conferences bring together developers and other interested people and lead to new ideas and projects that wouldn't have happened had the face-to-face dynamic been absent. By recording the talks and discussion, we also build media assets that can be viewed by a much larged global audience. COVID-19 makes this difficult at the moment, but as soon as people can travel again for conferences, I'd like to see BU return to organizing one to two events per year.
